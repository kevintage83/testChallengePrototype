# Test Challenge Prototype
This project is a Node.js/Express API that returns search results of famous explorers. Additionally, there is a test suite for the Node.js files. Can't you just type your query into the Google search engine? You sure could! A note to tech leads and senior software devs: Welcome! You're likely here because you need to see my coding chops! Express and NodeJS examples (which aren't locked behind a previous client's privacy settings/guidelines or blocked by an NDA) must be created in my free time. Sharable projects are relegated to simple apps like these! I'm sure [at least some of] you can relate. :-)

## Contributing
At this time, I am not handling pull requests; this repo is primarily here to serve as a topic of dicussion among developers. Normally, if this were a repository where pull requests were welcome, I would ask that (for major changes, at least) you please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change... but this is currently not the case.

I would also ask that you please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
